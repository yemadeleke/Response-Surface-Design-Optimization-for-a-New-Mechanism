# Response-Surface-Design-Optimization-for-a-New-Mechanism
This project was designed to optimize a newly designed and fabricated brush-based A.C. Motor-run mechanism for removing plastic contaminants from the dispersing cylinders of module feeders at cotton gins.
This approach can help to get the optimal setting for various factors that affect the p;astic removal efficiency (i.e., the fraction of plastic removed).
